## 📘 Overview

This Cache Memory Simulator is an implementation of a cache memory system with Least Frequently Used (LFU) replacement policy. The simulator demonstrates memory access patterns, cache hit/miss scenarios, and provides comprehensive logging of cache operations.

## ✨ Features

- Simulates a 5-block cache memory
- Implements Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache replacement strategy
- Detailed logging of memory access and cache state
- Random memory access testing
- Performance statistics tracking

## Resources
- [Simics examples](https://github.com/mmongeo/academia-collaboration)

## TODO 
- [ ] Modify the simulator to work without simics
- [ ] implement own equivalent of constants.py
- [ ] implement system that can use multiple replacement policies
- [ ] implement system that can use multiple cores to simulate multi-core systems
